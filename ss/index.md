Days of Elijah
--------
These are the days of Elijah  
Declaring the word of the Lord  
And these are the days of Your servant Moses  
Righteousness being restored  

And though these are days of great trial  
Of famine and darkness and sword  
Still, we are the voice in the desert crying  
"Prepare ye the way of the Lord!"

**CHORUS**  
Behold He comes riding on the clouds  
Shining like the sun at the trumpet call  
Lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee  
And out of Zion's hill salvation comes  

**V2**  
These are the days of Ezekiel  
The dry bones becoming as flesh  
And these are the days of Your servant David  
Rebuilding a temple of praise  

These are the days of the harvest  
The fields are as white in Your world  
And we are the labourers in Your vineyard  
Declaring the word of the Lord!

**CHORUS**

Every Move I Make

Every move I make I make in You  
You make me move Jesus  
Every breath I take I breathe in You  
Every step I take I take in You  
You are my way Jesus  
Every breath I take I breathe in You  

Waves of mercy, waves of grace  
Everywhere I look I see your face  
Your love has captured me  
Oh my God this love how can it be?
