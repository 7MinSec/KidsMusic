All in All
-------
You are my strength when I am weak  
You are the treasure that I seek  
You are my all in all  

Seeking You as a precious jewel  
Lord, to give up I'd be a fool  
You are my all in all  

**CHORUS**  
Jesus, Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name  
Jesus, Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name

**V2**  
Taking my sin, my cross, my shame  
Rising again I bless Your name  
You are my all in all

When I fall down You pick me up  
When I am dry You fill my cup  
You are my all in all

Jesus, Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name  
Jesus, Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name

Amazing Love
--------
I’m forgiven because You were forsaken  
I’m accepted, You were condemned  
I’m alive and well, Your spirit is within me  
Because You died and rose again

**CHORUS**  
Amazing love how can it be?  
That You my King would die for me?  
Amazing love I know it’s true  
That it’s my joy to honor You  
In all I do, I honor You

**BRIDGE**
You are my King
You are my King
Jesus You are my King
Jesus You are my King

**CHORUS**

Beautiful One
--------
Wonderful, so wonderful
Is your unfailing love  
Your cross has spoken mercy over me  
No eye has seen no ear has heard  
No heart could fully know  
How glorious, how beautiful you are

**CHORUS**  
Beautiful one I love  
Beautiful one I adore  
Beautiful one my soul must sing

**V2**  
Powerful so powerful  
Your glory fills the skies  
Your mighty works displayed for all to see  
The beauty of your majesty  
Awakes my heart to see  
How marvelous how wonderful you are

**CHORUS 2x**

**BRIDGE**  
You opened my eyes to your wonders anew  
You captured my heart with this love  
Because nothing on Earth is as beautiful as you (repeat)

Better is One Day
--------
How lovely is Your dwelling place  
oh Lord Almighty  
My soul longs and even faints for You  
For here my heart is satisfied  
within Your presence  
I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings  

**CHORUS**  
Better is one day in Your courts  
Better is one day in Your house  
Better is one day in Your courts  
Than thousands elsewhere

**V2**  
One thing I ask and I would seek  
to see Your beauty  
To find You in the place Your glory dwells  

**CHORUS**  

**BRIDGE**  
My heart and flesh cry out  
for You the living God  
Your spirit's water for my soul  
I've tasted and I've seen  
come once again to me  
I will draw near to You  
I will draw near to You

**CHORUS**

Blessed Be
-------
Blessed be the Lord our God of Israel  
From everlasting to everlasting  
Blessed be the Lord our God of Israel  
From everlasting to everlasting

**CHORUS**  
Let all God’s people shout amen (AMEN!)  
Let all God’s people shout amen (AMEN!)  
Let all God’s people shout amen (AMEN!)  
Oh praise the Lord

Whoop, whoop, here we go here we go  
Whoop, whoop, one more time  
Whoop, whoop yeah!

Christ Be All Around Me
--------
As I wait, heart of God  
Satisfy and sustain  
As I hear, voice of God  
Lead me on, be my guide  
Oh be my guide  

**CHORUS**  
Above and below me  
Before and behind me  
In every eye that sees me  
Christ be all around me

Above and below me
Before and behind me
In every eye that sees me
Christ be all around me (yeah)

**V2**  
And as I go, hand of God  
My defense, by my side  
And as I rest, breath of God  
Fall upon, bring me peace  
Oh bring me peace

**CHORUS**

**BRIDGE**  
Your life, Your death  
Your blood was shed  
For every moment  
Every moment (*repeat 4x*)  

Days of Elijah
--------
These are the days of Elijah  
Declaring the word of the Lord  
And these are the days of Your servant Moses  
Righteousness being restored  

And though these are days of great trial  
Of famine and darkness and sword  
Still, we are the voice in the desert crying  
"Prepare ye the way of the Lord!"

**CHORUS**  
Behold He comes riding on the clouds  
Shining like the sun at the trumpet call  
Lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee  
And out of Zion's hill salvation comes  

**V2**  
These are the days of Ezekiel  
The dry bones becoming as flesh  
And these are the days of Your servant David  
Rebuilding a temple of praise  

These are the days of the harvest  
The fields are as white in Your world  
And we are the labourers in Your vineyard  
Declaring the word of the Lord!

**CHORUS**

Every Move I Make
-------
Every move I make I make in You  
You make me move Jesus  
Every breath I take I breathe in You  
Every step I take I take in You  
You are my way Jesus  
Every breath I take I breathe in You  

Waves of mercy, waves of grace  
Everywhere I look I see your face  
Your love has captured me  
Oh my God this love how can it be?

(*Repeat whole song*)

**Bridge**  
La la la la la la…  
La la la la la la…  
La la la la la la…  
La la la la la la…  

Forever Reign
------
You are good You are good  
When there's nothing good in me  
You are love You are love  
On display for all to see  
You are light You are light  
When the darkness closes in  
You are hope You are hope  
You have covered all my sin  

**CHORUS**  
And oh, I'm running to Your arms  
I'm running to Your arms  
The riches of Your love  
Will always be enough  
Nothing compares to Your embrace  
Light of the world forever reign

**V2**  
You are more You are more  
Than my words will ever say  
You are Lord You are Lord  
All creation will proclaim  
You are here You are here  
In Your presence I'm made whole  
You are God You are God  
Of all else I'm letting go  

**CHORUS**

My heart will sing no other Name  
Jesus Jesus (*repeat 4x*)

Here I Am to Worship
------
Light of the world you stepped down into darkness  
Opened my eyes let me see  
Beauty that made this heart adore You  
Hope of a life spent with You  

**CHORUS**  
Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down  
Here I am to say that You’re my God  
You’re altogether lovely, altogether worthy  
Altogether wonderful to me

**VERSE2**  
King of all days oh so highly exalted  
Glorious in heaven above  
Humbly you came to the earth You created  
All for love’s sake became poor

**CHORUS**

**BRIDGE**  
And I’ll never know how much it costs  
To see my sin upon that cross  
And I’ll never know how much it costs  
To see my sin upon that cross

How Great is Our God
--------
The splendor of the King  
Clothed in majesty  
Let all the earth rejoice  
All the earth rejoice  

He wraps himself in Light  
And darkness tries to hide  
And trembles at His voice  
Trembles at His voice

**CHORUS**  
How great is our God, sing with me  
How great is our God, and all will see  
How great, how great is our God

**V2**  
Age to age He stands  
And time is in His hands  
Beginning and the end  
Beginning and the end  

The Godhead Three in One  
Father Spirit Son  
The Lion and the Lamb  
The Lion and the Lamb  

**CHORUS**

**BRIDGE**  
Name above all names  
Worthy of our praise  
My heart will sing  
How great is our God  

**CHORUS**
