# Christmas program

**Narration**:  And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.  And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.  

**Narration**:  And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem (because he was of the house and lineage of David).

In a Little Stable – Little Lambs
--------

**V1**: In a little stable  
Far across the sea  
Was a little baby  
Just like you and me  

**V2**: Not a bed or cradle  
Not a pillow deep  
But a lowly manger  
Was His place to sleep

**Narration**:  He was to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.  And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.

**Narration**:  And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.

Away in a Manger - ELW 277
--------
**V1 (LL)**: Away in a manger  
no crib for His bed  
the little Lord Jesus  
laid down His sweet head

The stars in the bright sky  
look down where He lay  
the little Lord Jesus  
asleep on the hay  

**V2 (All kids)**: The cattle are lowing  
The poor baby awakes  
but little Lord Jesus  
no crying He makes  

I love you, Lord Jesus  
look down from the sky  
and stay by my cradle  
'til morning is nigh  

**V3 (congregation)**: Be near me, Lord Jesus  
I ask you to stay  
close by me forever  
and love me, I pray  

Bless all the dear children  
in your tender care  
and take us to heaven  
to live with you there  

**Narration**:  And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flocks by night.  And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them; and they were sore afraid.

**Narration**:  And the angel said unto them, Fear not; for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be unto all people.  For unto you a Savior is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.

**Narration**:  And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.  And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,

ALL:  Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill!

Go Tell it On The Mountain - ELW 290
-------

**CHORUS**: Go tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go tell it on the mountain  
Our Jesus Christ is born  

**V1 (SS)**: While shepherds kept their watching  
O’er silent flocks by night  
Behold throughout the heavens  
There shone a holy light  

**CHORUS**

**V2 (Solo)**: The shepherds feared and trembled  
When lo above the earth  
Rang out the angel chorus  
That hailed our Savior’s birth  

**CHORUS**

**V3 (Solo)**: Down in a lonely manger  
The humble Christ was born  
And God sent us salvation  
That bless-ed Christmas morn  

**CHORUS**


**Narration**:  And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.

**Narration**:  And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.  And when they had seen it, they made it known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.  And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.

The First Noel - ELW 300
------

**V1 (Solo)**: The First Noel the angels did say  
Was to certain poor shepherds   
In fields as they lay  
In fields where they lay   
Keeping their sheep  
On a cold winter's night that was so deep  

**CHORUS**: Noel Noel Noel Noel  
Born is the King of Israel!  

**V2 (Congregation)**: They looked up and saw a star  
Shining in the East beyond them far  
And to the earth it gave great light  
And so it continued both day and night  

**CHORUS**

**Narration**:  Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews?  For we have seen his star in the east, and have come to worship him.

**Narration**:  And lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.  When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.

**Narration**: And when they were in the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him; and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

**Narration**: And all that heard it wondered at those things which were told them.  But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.

Silent Night ELW - 281

**V1 (all kids)**: Silent Night Holy Night  
All is calm All is bright  
Round yon virgin  
Mother and child  
Holy infant so tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  

**V2 (congregation)**: Silent night, holy night!  
Shepherds quake at the sight.  
Glories stream from heaven afar  
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia,  
Christ the Savior is born!  
Christ the Savior is born  

**V3 (congregation)**: Silent night, holy night!  
Son of God love's pure light.  
Radiant beams from your holy face  
With the dawn of redeeming grace,

Joy to the World - ELW267
--------
**V1**: Joy to the world! The Lord is come:  
let earth receive her King!  
Let every heart prepare him room  
and heaven and nature sing  
and heaven and nature sing  
and heaven and heaven and nature sing  

**V2**: Joy to the earth, the Savior reigns!  
Let all their songs employ;  
While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains  
Repeat the sounding joy,  
Repeat the sounding joy,  
Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy  

**V3**: No more let sins and sorrows grow,  
Nor thorns infest the ground;  
He comes to make His blessings flow  
Far as the curse is found,  
Far as the curse is found,  
Far as, far as, the curse is found  

**V4**: He rules the world with truth and grace,  
And makes the nations prove  
The glories of His righteousness,  
And wonders of His love,  
And wonders of His love,  
And wonders, wonders, of His love
