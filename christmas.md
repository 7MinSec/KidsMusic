**Little Lambs**: Away in a manger no crib for a bed  
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head  
The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay  

**Solo**: The cattle are lowing the baby awakes  
The little Lord Jesus no crying He makes  
I love Thee, Lord Jesus look down from the sky   
And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh  

**Solo**: Be near me, Lord Jesus I ask Thee to stay   
Close by me forever and love me I pray  
Bless all the dear children in you tender care   
And fit us for heaven to live with thee there  

**Little Lambs**: Away in a manger no crib for a bed  
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head  
The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay

## The First Noel
The First Noel, the Angels did say  
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay  
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep  
On a cold winter's night that was so deep   
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  

They looked up and saw a star shining in the East beyond them far  
And to the earth it gave great light, and so it continued both day and night  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  

And by the light of that same star three Wise men came from country far  
To seek for a King was their intent and to follow the star wherever it went  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel born is the King of Israel!

## Joy to the World
*(Little Lambs, Singing Shepherds, Congregation)*

Joy to the world, the Lord is come  
Let earth receive her King  
Let every heart prepare Him room  
And Heaven and nature sing  
And Heaven and nature sing  
And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing

Joy to the World, the Savior reigns!  
Let men their songs employ  
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains  
Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy  

No more let sin and sorrow grow  
Nor thorns infest the ground  
He comes to make His blessings flow  
Far as the curse is found  
Far as the curse is found  
Far as, far as the curse is found  

He rules the world with truth and grace  
And makes the nations prove  
The light of His righteousness  
And wonders of His love  
And wonders of His love  
And wonders, wonders, of His love

## Oh Come All Ye Faithful
 *(Congregation and solos)*

**Verse 1**  
O come, all ye faithful joyful and triumphant  
O come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem  
Come and behold Him born the King of Angels!  

**Chorus**  
O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him  
Christ the Lord  

**Verse 2**
The highest most holy light of light eternal  
Born of a virgin immortal he comes  
Son of the Father now in flesh appearing  

**Chorus**

**Verse 3**  
Oh, sing, choirs of angels sing in exultation  
Sing all ye citizens of heaven above  
Glory to God in the highest  

**Chorus**  

**Verse 4**  
Ye Lord we greet Thee, born this happy morning  
O Jesus! for evermore be Thy name adored  
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing  

**Chorus**  

## Oh Come Little Children
*(Singing Shepherds)*

O come, little children, oh come one and come all  
O come to the manger in Bethlehem's stall  
And see what our Father in heaven above  
Has sent to us all on this earth with His love  

O see in the manger so meek and so mild  
O see in the soft light the heavenly Child  
In swaddling clothes folded his beauty more sweet   
Than angels, whose voices his lowly birth greet  

His bed, little children, a manger with hay  
 His mother and Joseph in ecstasy pray  
 The Shepherds in wonder their glad worship bring  
While chorus of angels sweet Glorias sing
