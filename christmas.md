## Oh Come All Ye Faithful
 *(Congregation and solos)*

**Verse 1 (Monica & Morgan)**  
O come, all ye faithful joyful and triumphant  
O come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem  
Come and behold Him born the King of Angels!  

**Chorus**  
O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him  
Christ the Lord  

**Verse 2 (Congregation)**  
The highest most holy light of light eternal  
Born of a virgin immortal he comes  
Son of the Father now in flesh appearing  

**Chorus**

**Verse 3 (Owen)**  
Oh, sing, choirs of angels sing in exultation  
Sing all ye citizens of heaven above  
Glory to God in the highest  

**Chorus**  

**Verse 4**  
Ye Lord we greet Thee, born this happy morning  
O Jesus! for evermore be Thy name adored  
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing  

**Chorus**

**(Owen**: “We have to go to Bethlehem,” Joseph told Mary.  Emperor Augustus has ordered that all people need to be counted.

**Kerris**: Mary and Joseph journeyed to Bethlehem, the City of David, to be counted along with all of the other people. It was cold when they arrived. Joseph knocked on many doors looking for a room but everyone said no, finally an innkeeper answered his door.

## The First Noel
The First Noel, the Angels did say  
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay  
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep  
On a cold winter's night that was so deep   
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  

They looked up and saw a star shining in the East beyond them far  
And to the earth it gave great light, and so it continued both day and night  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  

And by the light of that same star three Wise men came from country far  
To seek for a King was their intent and to follow the star wherever it went  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel born is the King of Israel!

**Monica**: “I have no room”, said the innkeeper. “But you can stay in the little stable in the back. It’s warm, and the hay is fresh. “Joseph”, Mary said. “I think it’s time for the baby to be born."

**Little Lambs**: Away in a manger no crib for a bed  
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head  
The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay  

**Maddy and Cohen**: The cattle are lowing the baby awakes  
The little Lord Jesus no crying He makes  
I love Thee, Lord Jesus look down from the sky   
And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh  

**Genna**: Be near me, Lord Jesus I ask Thee to stay   
Close by me forever and love me I pray  
Bless all the dear children in you tender care   
And fit us for heaven to live with thee there  

**Little Lambs**: Away in a manger no crib for a bed  
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head  
The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay

**Owen**: Outside of Bethlehem, shepherds watched their sheep on the hills. Suddenly, an angel appeared. The shepherds looked up at the bright night sky.

**Morgan:** The angel said, “Do not be afraid, I bring you wonderful news. The child of God promised was born tonight.” Go to Bethlehem!  You will find the child lying in a bed of hay!”

**McCoy**: Many angels filled the heavens and sang together,
“Glory to God in the highest. And peace to all people on Earth!”

**Genna**: The Shepherds left their sheep for the angels to
watch over them! The angel said the baby is the Messiah – the promised one. He is the one we have waited for,”

**Kerris**: That night Mary gave birth to Jesus. She laid him in a manager. The animals kept them warm as they waited for morning.

**McCoy**: Three wise men looked into the night sky and saw a bright star. The wise men had been waiting for someone important to come into the world. They were waiting for a king. They know that the star was a sign from God.

**Genna**: “The star is a sign that the king has been born!”
We should follow the star and find him!

**Monica**: They wanted to worship him and give him gifts.

## Joy to the World
*(Little Lambs, Singing Shepherds, Congregation)*

Joy to the world, the Lord is come  
Let earth receive her King  
Let every heart prepare Him room  
And Heaven and nature sing  
And Heaven and nature sing  
And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing

Joy to the World, the Savior reigns!  
Let men their songs employ  
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains  
Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy  

No more let sin and sorrow grow  
Nor thorns infest the ground  
He comes to make His blessings flow  
Far as the curse is found  
Far as the curse is found  
Far as, far as the curse is found  

He rules the world with truth and grace  
And makes the nations prove  
The light of His righteousness  
And wonders of His love  
And wonders of His love  
And wonders, wonders, of His love
