In the beginning God made the sea
And the forest filled with trees  
He made the mountains up so high
Above it all He placed the sky  

God’s fingerprints are everywhere
Just to show how much He cares  
And in between, he had lots of fun!
He made a hippo that weighs a ton!

Hip hip hip hippopotamus!  
Hip hip hurray God made all of us! (repeat)

Zacchaeus was a wee little man  
and a wee little man was he  
He climbed up in a sycamore tree  
For the Lord he wanted to see  

And as the Savior passed his way  
He looked up in the tree  
And he said, 'Zacchaeus, you come down!  

For I'm going to your house today!  
For I'm going to your house today!
